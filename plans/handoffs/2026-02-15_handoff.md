# Session Handoff — 2026-02-15

## Session Summary

- Executed 10-issue sprint across 5 concurrent Claude instances (I1-I5)
- Merged 8 PRs total: 3 in 3ngram (#19, #25, #26), 5 in p&s (#50, #51, #52, #53, #54)
- Resolved merge conflicts when PRs to p&s main caused cascading behind-main states
- Addressed all Copilot review comments across all PRs (fixes applied or reasoning provided)
- Cleaned up all stale branches across both repos — only `main` remains in each
- Added labels to all PRs (previously missing)

## Current State

- Milestone: M4 (Specification) — in progress
- Phase: Stage 3 (Specification)
- Branch: `main` (both repos)
- Working tree: clean (both repos)
- p&s local is 5 commits behind origin/main (needs `git pull`)

## What Was Delivered

### 3ngram

| PR | Title | Issues |
|----|-------|--------|
| #26 | Expand ruff rules, add vulture/pip-audit, project scripts | #20, #21 |
| #25 | M4 agent skills (spec, schema, architecture) | #22 |

### policies-and-standards

| PR | Title | Issues |
|----|-------|--------|
| #50 | Post-merge health check workflow | #24 |
| #51 | Daily report template, tooling update, tool discovery amendments | #47, #48, #49 |

| #53 | Vendor-agnostic CI failure notification workflow | #29 |
| #54 | Dependency caching for gate workflows | #28 |

## Next Tasks

- Start Stage 3 specification work (schema definitions first, then tech specs per module)
- Create ExecPlan for Stage 3 as required by PLANS.md
- Close 3ngram #23 and #24 (cross-project scripts/skills — may already be done from session 8)
- Address remaining p&s issues: #39 (STD-030 failure notification requirement — may be partially covered by #53)
- Continue p&s backlog triage (21 open issues remain)

## Open Questions

- Are 3ngram #23 and #24 (cross-project scripts/skills) still relevant or were they completed in session 8?
- Should p&s #39 (STD-030 failure notification requirement) be closed since #53 implemented the notification workflow?
- Sprint plan included I3 work on p&s #49 (agent tool discovery) — verify STD-056/054/058 amendments landed in PR #51
