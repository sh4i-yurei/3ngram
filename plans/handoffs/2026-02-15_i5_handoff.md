## What I5 Delivered

### Session-management skill (user-level)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `~/.claude/skills/session-management/SKILL.md` | Skill definition |
| `~/.claude/skills/session-management/references/session-handoff-template.md` | TPL-PRJ-HANDOFF |
| `~/.claude/skills/session-management/references/session-review-template.md` | TPL-PRJ-SESSION-REVIEW |
| `~/.claude/skills/session-management/references/std-061-summary.md` | STD-061 key requirements |

### p&s PR #50 — post-merge health check (closes #24)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.github/workflows/post-merge.yml` | Reusable post-merge workflow |
| `.github/workflows/post-merge-trigger.yml` | p&s local trigger |

Key features: configurable governance file checks, optional .kb directory
validation, docs lint (markdownlint + yamllint + cspell), optional link
check, optional code gates (Python), failure notification via issue creation
with deduplication.

### p&s PR #53 — CI failure notifications (closes #29)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.github/workflows/notify-on-failure.yml` | Reusable notification workflow |
| `05_Dev_Workflows/CI_CD_Pipeline_Model.md` | STD-030 v1.1.7 amendment |

Key features: issue creation with deduplication, label existence validation,
Slack-compatible webhook, input injection prevention via env vars.

## Next Tasks

- Start Stage 3 specification work (schema definitions first)
- Create ExecPlan for Stage 3 per PLANS.md
- Close p&s #39 if #53 satisfies the STD-030 failure notification requirement

## Open Questions

- Should p&s #39 be closed since PR #53 implemented the notification workflow?
- Post-merge workflow cspell step references `.cspell.json` — consuming repos
  must have this config or the step will fail

## Key Files to Read First

2. `.github/workflows/post-merge.yml` (p&s) — reusable post-merge workflow
